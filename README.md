# AUTOMATED-QUICK-EDA-WITH-SWEETVIZ-
INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON'S SWEETVIZ LIBRARY Sweetviz is an open source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with a single line of code. Output is a fully self-contained HTML application.  The system is built around quickly visualizing target values and comparing datasets. Its goal is to help quick analysis of target characteristics, training vs testing data, and other such data characterization tasks.  Make sure you visit sweetviz.PyPI to explore more, and also consult and go through documentation of this library.  DATASET USED FOR EDA : I have used train and test datasets from the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition hosted by KAGGLE, for performing the EDA.  You can find the datasets at the following link redirected to KAGGLE :  https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
